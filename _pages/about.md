I am a geotechnical engineer with an experimental background. Over the last 10 years, I have focused on instrumentation and numerical modeling of real-world problems. 
My areas of interests include the mechanical responses of geo-materials and, more recently, wave mechanics.

I earned my BSc from the Uni. of Minnesota-Twin Cities and my MSc from the Uni. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
In 2020, I was awarded an honorable mention for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship 
with a research topic on "*brittle creep of basalts for carbon mineralization*". 
Unfortunately, due to a lack of funding, my application to continue my studies was withdrawn.

Despite the setback, I shifted my focus to machine learning, where I strive for creativity in my work. 
In 2021, I began working on several personal projects using Python and data-driven approaches. In the same year,
I also became a member of the ASCE G-I Soil Improvement Committee.
