I am a geotechnical engineer. Having an experimental background, I have spent the last 10 years working on instrumentation and numerical modeling of real-world problems. 
My areas of interests are the mechanical responses of geo-materials and, more recently, wave mechanics.

Previously, I earned my BSc from the U of Minnesota-Twin Cities and my MSc from the U of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
In 2020, I was awarded HM for the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship 
with a research topic in "*brittle creep of basalts for carbon mineralization*". 
However, due to the pandemic and health issue, my application to further study was withdrawn.

Despite the setback, I shifted my focus to machine learning. I strive for creativity in my work. 
In 2021, I started working on a few personal projects using Python and data-driven approaches.
