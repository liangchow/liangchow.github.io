I am a geotechnical engineer. Having a bit of an experimental research background, I have spent the last 10 years working on instrumentation and numerical modeling of real-world problems. 
My interests are in the mechanical responses of geo-materials and, more recently, wave mechanics.

Previously, I completed my BSc from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and MSc from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I try to be creative with my work. In 2021, I started a few personal "fun" projects using Python and data-driven approaches.
