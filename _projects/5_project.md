[GeoTechTools (SHRP 2 R02)](https://www.geoinstitute.org/geotechtools/) is a free online interactive geotechnology selection system used by practicing engineers, educators, 
regulators, and students. The majority of the geotechnologies included in GeoTechTools are ground improvement technologies. The GeoTechTools system was developed in 2011 
by geotechnology experts, many of whom are members of the Soil Improvement Committee. 

GeoTechTools encompasses 47 technologies that can be sorted into 11 categories. In this collaborative effort, I helped update the technologies by drawing experience from two projects:

> [Prefabricated Vertical Drains and Fill Preloading](https://www.geoinstitute.org/node/16159) <br>
> Expansion of US Highway 14 over organic soils using a combination of PVD (a.k.a. wick drains) and surcharge to minimize post-surcharge secondary settlement.
>
> [Excavation and Replacement](https://www.geoinstitute.org/geotechtools/) <br>
> Improvement of I-90 Dresbach Interchange by muck-excavation supplemented with a geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring program.
