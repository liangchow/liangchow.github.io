A reservoir is an artificial lake where water is stored and its outlet is dammed to control the water level for use, such as water supply, irrigation, hydroelectric power etc. 
In California, there are more than a thousand major reservoirs, where most large reservoirs are located in the central and northern portions of the state. 
As [climate change](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/All-Programs/Climate-Change-Program/Climate-Change-and-Water) increasingly impacts California's water resources, reservoir storages
become increasingly variables between years. Water supply projections, therefore, also becomes challenging and less predictable.

	This project is about a reservoir in Napa Valley, California that serves as one of the 
	three city's water sources. In 2020, the valley faced a severe drought when the reservoir 
	storage was projected to drop to 33% low by November. The city declared a water emergency 
	by July 2020. Unfortunately, as part of the state's reservoir reporting program, there was 
	a gap in the water level monitoring data: three years of data were missing between June 2019 
	and July 2022. My primary task in this project included forecasting water levels for those 
	months with missing data, closing the gap.

The reservoir data is a time-series, recorded water levels describing the reservoir capacity over a period of time. Water levels, which are converted to elevation (NAVD88), were manually collected as 
early as 1980s. Data interval varies from ocassionally weekly data to most of the time, monthly data. As a results, data preparation process was a bit challenging, at the cost of coarser data resolution for model fitting.
The project involved the application of Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model to fit data and forecast.
